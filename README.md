Pandas Mini Project
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed for data analysis and manipulation using Python. The project simulates a scenario where a data analyst at a university processes and analyzes student performance data.

Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for cleaning, analyzing, and manipulating a dataset. The main tasks include:

Loading and cleaning datasets.
Transforming and indexing data for better accessibility.
Extracting insights into student performance to make actionable recommendations.

Dataset Description
The notebook processes multiple datasets containing information about:

Student Roster:

NetID: Transformed to lowercase and set as an index.
Email Address: Converted to lowercase.
Section: Included in the cleaned dataset.
Homework and Exam Data:

Indexed by SID.
Columns containing the word "Submission" are removed.
Steps Covered in the Notebook
1. Data Cleaning
Modify the roster for uniform formatting.
Remove unnecessary columns from datasets based on specific keywords.
2. Data Transformation
Apply indexing and transformations to prepare the data for analysis.
Restructure the data to align with analytical needs.
3. Data Analysis
Analyze trends in student performance.
Provide recommendations for improving outcomes based on extracted insights.

Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Libraries:
numpy
pandas

Key Features
Simulated real-world data analysis tasks for a university setting.
Step-by-step transformations to demonstrate practical applications of Pandas and NumPy.
Focus on data cleaning and analysis workflows.
